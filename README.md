# java-reboot

Small repo to refresh my Java skills after spending time with Python and C++.

The goal is to keep things simple:
- Relearn basic syntax
- Practice OOP concepts
- Refresh Java collections
- Solve a few classic interview-style questions

I’m not aiming for a full project here, just clean, focused examples.

## Structure

- `basics/` – syntax, types, control flow
- `oop/` – classes, inheritance, polymorphism
- `collections/` – `List`, `Set`, `Map`, iteration
- `exercises/` – small coding problems (e.g. plus-one, two-sum)

## How to run

From the root folder:

```bash
# Compile
javac basics/HelloWorld.java

# Run
java HelloWorld
